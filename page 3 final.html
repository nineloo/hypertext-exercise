        Dezzie: Hello fashion killa! Okay so here, I have selected two main brands for you you to choose from. As you click through, I have selected for you pieces that I thought would work fabulously with your selections. 
        You could say I am <u>the</u> diva when it comes to this.
        <br> Anyways, have fun!
